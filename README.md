# Capstone2
Springboard Data Science Capstone project #2
This is my first independent capstone for Springboardâ€™s Data Science Program. 

In this project I will attempt to model STAAR scores based on publicly available district data provided by TEA. This is a work in progress. The workflow order is as follows:

-Data Wrangling
-EDA
-Preprocessing
-Modeling

I will soon create an report communicating my results and an executive slidedeck.
